# Goals
1. Pass all my courses (6)
2. Finish CAP system
3. Read Python book / Learn Python
4. Master data structures and algorithms
5. Grind Leetcode
6. Step up my English
7. Land a tech job
___
#  Courses of action
From my goals list I identify the following 2 main courses of action:
## 1. University responsibilities
This consist in approving all my courses from [[UCR 1-2025]] semester.
It also includes comply with my hours at the CAP. I believe that if I [[diligently]] do all 6 weekly hours we (me and Milton) can finish the system by the end of the semester.

## 2. Problem solving mastery and work interviews
I can't afford to be left behind in getting a job quickly and accumulate work experience for that reason I need to get sharp in some key skills and consistently apply to jobs. Even if I don't get a job at Amazon or Microsoft this are extremely valuable skills that will help me in my career. They are:

**Python**
I need to get proficient at Python to code faster and in the future to build a cool project in order to showcase my AI skills. See the book [[Think Python.pdf]].
___
**Data structures and algorithms**
For DS & Algorithms I recommend studying them as I did in my UCR previous course and practice them with spaced repetition. I think is just good to know these as a CS engineer.
___
**Problem solving**
For problem solving skills I recommend grinding Leetcode. Here's the [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).
**Note**: It is good to understand common interviews questions by practicing Leetcode regularly
___
**English**
For English my plan is to practice every day as much as I can and I am doing flashcards but that's not enough to get certified. I need to define a structured English preparation plan.
___
# The System
**Core Principles**: Time-blocking + Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix) + Consistency (Atomic Habits)
## Weekly Structure
**Sleep schedule**: 22:00 to 5:00 every day
___
### 1. University Responsibilities
**Time**: 59 hrs/week
- Classes: 25 hrs (5 courses × 5 hrs each, Mon to Fri).
- Study work: 28 hrs (4 courses × 7 hrs each).
- Cap System Work: 6 hrs (2 sessions × 3 hrs each with Milton - Track in [Jira](https://brandontrg.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/KAN/boards/1))

**Actions**:
1. Block CAP work as non-negotiable sessions.
	Session 1: Saturday 8:30 to 11:30
	Session 2: Saturday 13:00 to 16:00
	
2. Use workdays to do assignments and as study time. My main goal is to learn so i **commit** to study hard every hour i have.

___
### 2. Problem Solving & Job Prep
- **Time**: 18 hrs/week
#### Python Basics: 4 hrs/week
- **Study**: 2 hrs/week (use [[Think Python.pdf]])
- **Solve book exercises**: 2 hrs/week (track progress here) <- #TODO: create GitHub repository and link readme here.
#### DSA & Leetcode: 10 hrs/week
- **Study**: 4 hrs/week (use [[Introduction to Algorithms.pdf]] + spaced repetition).
- **Leetcode**: 6 hrs/week (follow [Neetcode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)).
#### English Level step-up: 4 hrs/week
**TOEFL Prep**:
- **Study**: 4 hrs/week. Define a structured English preparation plan <- #TODO 
- Flashcards in Obsidian.
- Passive Practice (YouTube videos, notetaking in english and job interviews).
#### Job Applications
- **Weeks 4–16**: Apply to 5 jobs/week (tailor resume/portfolio).
- Practice behavioral interviews.

## Tools, Tracking & Techniques

### Tools
1. [**Jira**](https://brandontrg.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/KAN/boards/1):
	- CAP project milestones.
2. [**Google Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week): 
	- Time-block study sessions.
	- Track university deadlines.
3. [**Obsidian**](https://github.com/BrandonTrigueros/ObsidianVault):
	- Flashcards for English vocabulary.
	- University courses notetaking and tasks tracking.
	- DSA notetaking.
	- DSA examples & Leetcode progress #TODO <- Create DSA examples & Leetcode progress table note (incorporate spaced repetition).
4. [**GitHub**](https://github.com/):
	- Version control for CAP system.
	- University Repositories.
	- Think Python Exercises and notes.

### Daily Note Template
1. To-do list ordered with Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize.
2. Habits Review
#TODO <- Make daily note template to review at nights.

### Weekly Review Template
1. Did I meet 80% of my goals?
2. What needs more time?
3. List 3 small victories.
4. List next week objetives.
#TODO <- Make weekly note template to review on Sunday nights.
