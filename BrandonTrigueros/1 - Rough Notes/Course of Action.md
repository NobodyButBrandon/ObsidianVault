#  Courses of action
From my goals list I identify the following 3 main courses of action:

## 1. University responsibilities
This consist in approving all my courses from 1-2025 semester. Which includes:
- Computer architecture
- Numerical analysis
- [[Advanced databases]]
- Experiment design
- Theatre appreciation

It also includes comply with my hours at the CAP. I believe that if I [[diligently]] do all 6 weekly hours we (me and Milton) can finish the system by the end of the semester.

## 2. Career Interest (AI) projects
I want to build a career as a artificial intelligence or machine learning engineer. To do so I need to learn about classical artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, AI mathematics and more. One way to start is by studying [[Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach.pdf]]. I also need to understand the underlying mathematics of this topics. Do this by studying [[Mathematics for Machine Learning.pdf]].

Not all is theory so I propose to put these concepts into practice by developing all my assignments from my previous AI course at the same time that I begin to build an AI portfolio with these assignments as mini-projects. See [[AI UCR course assignments]]

In addition to this I want to get proficient at Python to build a cool project in order to showcase my AI skills. Python is great for this but I also want to know what I'm doing. See [[AI cool projects ideas]] and the book [[Think Python.pdf]].

## 3. Problem solving mastery and work interviews
I can't afford to be left behind in getting a job quickly and accumulate work experience for that reason I need to get sharp in some key skills and consistently apply to jobs. Even if I don't get a job at Amazon or Microsoft this are extremely valuable skills that will help me in my career. They are:

**Data structures and algorithms**
For DS & Algorithms I recommend studying them as I did in my UCR previous course and practice them with spaced repetition. I think is just good to know these as a CS engineer.
___
**Problem solving**
For problem solving skills I recommend grinding Leetcode. Here's the [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and also can use [[Cracking the Coding Interview.pdf]]
**Note**: It is good to understand common interviews questions by practicing Leetcode regularly as this will get you through the door but remember that the projects will get you to the door.
___
**English**
For English my plan is to practice every day as much as I can and I am doing flashcards but that's not enough to get certified.
#TODO -> Define a structured English preparation plan.
___
# The System
**Core Principles**: Time-blocking + Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix) + Consistency (Atomic Habits)

## Weekly Structure
**Available time**: 83 hrs/week

### 1. University Responsibilities
**Time**: 56 hrs/week
- Classes: 25 hrs (4 courses × 5 hrs each)
- Study work: 25 hrs (4 courses × 5 hrs each)
- Cap System Work: 6 hrs (2 sessions × 3 hrs each with Milton - Track in [Jira](https://brandontrg.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/KAN/boards/1))

**Action**:
1. Block CAP work as non-negotiable sessions.
	Session 1: Saturday 5:00 to 8:00
	Session 2: Saturday 9:00 to 12:00
	
2. Use exclusively class days to do assignments and study work (L, K, J, V).

3. My main goal is to learn. So i commit to study hard every hour i have.

### 2. Career (AI) Projects
**Time**: 17 hrs/week
___
**Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-6)**
- **AI Book & Math**: 8 hrs/week
	- Read 2 chapters/week + notes using [AI book](obsidian://open?vault=BrandonTrigueros&file=Attachments%2FArtificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf)
	- Study linear algebra/probability (3 hrs/week) using [Mathematics for ML](obsidian://open?vault=BrandonTrigueros&file=Attachments%2FMathematics%20for%20Machine%20Learning.pdf)

- **Python Basics**: 4 hrs/week
	- Complete Think Python exercises (track progress [here](<file:///C:\Users\brand\OneDrive\Desktop\external file.md>))
