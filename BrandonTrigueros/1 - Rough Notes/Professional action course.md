#  Courses of action
From my goals list I identify the following 3 main courses of action:

## 1. University responsibilities
This consist in approving all my courses from 1-2025 semester. Which includes:
- Computer architecture
- Numerical analysis
- Advanced databases
- Experiment design
- Theatre [[Appreciation]]

It also includes comply with my hours at the CAP. I believe that if I [[diligently]] do all 6 weekly hours we (me and Milton) can finish the system by the end of the semester.

## 2. Career Interest (AI) projects
I want to build a career as a artificial intelligence or machine learning engineer. To do so I need to learn about classical artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, AI mathematics and more. One way to start is by studying [[Artificial Intelligence books]]. I also need to understand the underlying mathematics of this topics. Do this by studying [[Mathematics books]].

Not all is theory so I propose to put these concepts into practice by developing all my assignments from my previous AI course at the same time that I begin to build an AI portfolio with these assignments as mini-projects. See [[AI UCR course assignments]]

In addition to this I want to get proficient at Python to build a cool project in order to showcase my AI skills. Python is great for this but I also want to know what I'm doing. See [[AI cool projects ideas]] and the book [[Think Python.pdf]].

## 3. Problem solving mastery and work interviews
I can't afford to be left behind in getting a job quickly and accumulate work experience for that reason I need to get sharp in some key skills and consistently apply to jobs. Even if I don't get a job at Amazon or Microsoft this are extremely valuable skills that will help me in my career. They are:

**Data structures and algorithms**
For DS & Algorithms I recommend studying them as I did in my UCR previous course and practice them with spaced repetition. I think is just good to know these as a CS engineer.
___
**Problem solving**
For problem solving skills I recommend grinding Leetcode. Here's the [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and also can use [[Cracking the Coding Interview.pdf]]
**Note**: It is good to understand common interviews questions by practicing Leetcode regularly as this will get you through the door but remember that the projects will get you to the door.
___
**English**
For English my plan is to practice every day as much as I can and I am doing flashcards but that's not enough to get certified.
#TODO -> Find a way to step up my english and get certified.

# The System
In the making...
