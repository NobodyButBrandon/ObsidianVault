# Courses of action
From my goals list I identify the following 3 main courses of action:
## 1. University responsibilities
This consist in approving all my courses from 1-2025 semester. Which includes:
- Computer architecture
- Numerical analysis
- Advanced databases
- Experiment design
- Theatre Appreciation

It also includes comply with my hours at the CAP. I believe that if I [[diligently]] do all 6 weekly hours we (me and Milton) can finish the system by the end of the semester.
## 2. Career Interest (AI) projects
I want to build a career as a artificial intelligence or machine learning engineer. To do so I need to learn about classical artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, AI mathematics and more. One way to start is by studying [[Artificial Intelligence books]].

Not all is theory so I propose to put these concepts into practice by developing all my assignments from my previous AI course at the same time that I begin to build an AI portfolio with these assignments as mini-projects. See [[AI UCR course assignments]]
## 3. Problem solving mastery and work interviews
